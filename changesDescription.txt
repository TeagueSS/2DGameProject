From the original prompt I changed alot but kept the same overall idea.
Instead of making it Multiplayer and with controllers (Which I didn't have access to all the time)
I decided to keep the tower stacking, but change the game to be single player and add a theme.
Now I save my cat from Aliens!!!
An intro credit scene plays but the tower stacking itself is the same.

Using powerups to gain an advantage didn't make sense given I wasn't playing against another player.
So instead I added the elements and a boss to make it harder.

The elements include:
Wind, Rain, Snow 
These actually work very similar to the power ups
as they push objects one way or another, make them hard to lock, and get in the way.
(The original goals for the power ups)

The boss also acts to add some difficulty and I added making it throw blocks to make
it feel like every level has a new way that it makes it harder.
